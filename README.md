### Third raytracer

Built using _The Ray Tracer Challenge_ by Jamis Buck

To execute unit tests, run _python3 unit_tester.py_

The "saved_renders" folder contains samples from the end of each chapter, once we started rendering.

* _chap5.ppm_ - rendered the silhouette of a sphere
* _chap6.ppm_ - rendered a transformed (rotated, scaled in one dimension) sphere
* _chap7.ppm_ - rendered a scene of 6 spheres (3 of them appear to be walls)
* _chap8.ppm_ - added shadows
* _chap9.ppm_ - added planes (the floor is a plane instead of a sphere)
* _chap10.ppm_ - added various patterns
* _chap11_demo.ppm_ - added reflection and refraction. 
* _chap12_demo.ppm_ - added cubes and ability to set object as not casting a shadow

Jamis Buck posted details for the scenes shown in the book for chapters 11-13 on-line.  Links can be found in demoscenes.py.
